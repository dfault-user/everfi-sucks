i hate this stupid financial literaccy course so here's a tampermonkey script to make it less horrible

literally all it does is enable `a` tag buttons, and<br>add a button at the bottom of the screen to<br>enable disabled `button`s

use tampermonkey to create a new script...<br>
click extension, `[+]` new script, paste contents of `snake-aids.js` into area, ctrl+s to save.
